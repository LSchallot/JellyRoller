# JellyRoller - The CLI Jellyfin Controller Utility for Linux and Windows

JellyRoller is an open source CLI Jellyfin Controller written in Rust that works on Windows and Linux. Its primary purpose is to allow administration of a Jellyfin application from the command line.

## How it works
On the first execution, JellyRoller prompts for information to authenticate as an admin user.  Once this authentication has succeeded, an API key is created and stored within the JellyrRoller configuration.  JellyRoller then uses the Jellyfin API to manage the server.

Any previous user auth tokens will be converted to an API key upon next execution when upgrading from JellyRoller < 0.3.

## Installation

**Note:** All installation instructions assume the end-user can handle adding the application to their user's PATH.

### Mac / Linux (Homebrew)
```
brew tap LSchallot/JellyRoller https://github.com/LSchallot/JellyRoller
```
#### (Linux)
```
brew install jellyroller
```
#### (Mac)
```
brew install --build-from-source jellyroller
```
### Windows (Scoop)
```
scoop add bucket jellyroller https://github.com/lschallot/jellyroller.git
scoop update
scoop install jellyroller
```

### Building From Source

Currently built with rustc 1.83.0. If building on a Linux machine, you may need to install openssl-devel.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/LSchallot/JellyRoller
```

### Initial Configuration

When running JellyRoller for the first time, you will be prompted to configure against your Jellyfin instance. You will be prompted for various items which are described below.
| Prompt | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Please enter your Jellyfin URL: | The URL to your Jellyfin instance. Depending on your setup, you may need to provide the port. Examples include http://myjellyfin.lab or http://localhost:8096. |
| Please enter your Jellyfin username: | Username with admin rights that JellyRoller will use to execute commands. |
| Please enter your Jellyfin password: | Password associated with the username being used. |

### Custom Configuration
As of 0.5.0, it is possible to keep your configuration file alongside of the JellyRoller executable.  Simply save your configuration in the same directory with the name "jellyroller.config" and it will be used automatically.  Keep in mind that this configurtion file will contain your API key, so secure the file as needed.

### Downloading Release

See Releases for binaries. I can currently supply builds for x86_64 Windows and x86_64 Linux. Please open an issue if you would like to request an additional format.

## Roadmap

Please open issues for feature requests or enhancements.
